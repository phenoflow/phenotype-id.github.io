### Primary Care

In the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD, primary care data) we ascertained {{ page.name }} cases by searching for Read terms related to an {{ page.name }} diagnosis or evidence of endovascular/transluminal procedures related to the emergency repair of an aneurysmal segment of the aorta.


Read terms are hierarhically organized in top-level chapters i.e. chapter G....00 is related to Circulatory System Diseases and sub-headings i.e. heading G2...00 is related to Hypertensive Heart Disease while G3...00 is related to Ischaemic Heart Disease.

### Secondary Care

In Hospital Episode Statistics (HES, hospital admission data) we used ICD-10 terms (see below) for {{ page.name }} diagnosis when marked as the primary diagnosis i.e. the main condition treated or investigated during the relevant episode of healthcare. We used the date of admission to hospital as the date of the event. We additionally searched for OPCS-4 terms indicating the emergency repair of an aneurysmal segment of the aorta.
