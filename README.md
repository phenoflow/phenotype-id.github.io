# HDR UK National Phenotype Library (Phenotype.ID)

This is the HDR UK National Phenotype Library that provides comprehensive, open-access resource providing the research community with information, tools and phenotyping algorithms for UK electronic health records data.

## EHR Phenotypes
Rule-based phenotyping algorithms using four national structured UK EHR data sources: primary care (CPRD), hospitalizations (HES) and mortality (ONS). Phenoypes have been extensively validated by generating six layers of evidence: aetiological, prognostic, case-note review, genetic, cross-EHR and cross-country replication.

## Publications
CALIBER EHR phenotyping algorithms have been used in >60 peer-reviewed journal publications by 140 investigators from >40 national and international research groups.

## How to get access
Information on data access, guidance on research protocols and other related processes available on the main CALIBER website.

## Chronological map of human disease
We have produced the first chronological map of human health across multiple morbidities from birth to death. You can access the EHR phenotypes for >300 mental and health conditions in human and machine-readable formats.

## Codelists
Access codelists created and curated using UK primary care, hospital care and mortality EHR data sources using using Read codes (a subset of SNOMED-CT), ICD-9, ICD-10, OPCS-4 (analogous to Current Procedural Terminology terms) and Gemscript.
